# FECX(Front-end Contextual Experience) Convention

FECX (Front-end Contextual Experience Convention) is founded on the philosophy of "**writing the most human-readable code possible.**"

In modern front-end development, everything is built through bundlers, eliminating the need for abbreviations as was common in the past.

Since code is obfuscated by default in these environments, it ultimately needs to be readable by humans above all else.
